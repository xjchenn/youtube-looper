 Permission Justifications

  storage

  Why it's needed: This permission is essential for saving user preferences and loop configurations. Users can create multiple loop presets with custom start/end times for different videos or learning segments. The storage API
  allows these settings to persist across browser sessions, so users don't lose their saved loops when they close and reopen Chrome.

  User benefit: Enables saving and managing multiple loop presets, maintaining preferences across sessions, and providing a personalized experience without requiring users to reconfigure loops each time.

  activeTab

  Why it's needed: Required to interact with the currently active YouTube tab when users click the extension icon. This permission allows the extension to inject the loop control functionality only into the specific YouTube
  video tab the user is viewing, ensuring minimal permissions scope.

  User benefit: Provides secure, user-initiated access to control video playback only when explicitly activated by clicking the extension icon, maintaining user privacy on all other tabs.

  Host Permissions (youtube.com)

  Why it's needed: The extension needs to inject content scripts into YouTube pages to access and control the video player element. This allows the extension to monitor playback time, detect when the video reaches the loop end
  point, and automatically seek back to the start point.

  User benefit: Enables seamless loop functionality directly within YouTube's video player without requiring users to leave the site or use external tools. Works automatically on any YouTube video.
